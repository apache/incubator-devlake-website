# Development Workflow

This document shows the workflow of how to develop DevLake.

## Step 1 - Fork the repo

1. Visit the DevLake repo: https://github.com/apache/incubator-devlake;
2. Click the Fork button to create a fork of the DevLake;
3. We assume your fork is called `https://github.com/{user}/{repo}`.


## Step 2 - Clone the repo

1. Create your clone locally

```sh
mkdir -p ${WORKING_PATH}
cd ${WORKING_PATH}
# You can also use the url: git@github.com:merico-dev/lake.git
# if your ssh configuration is proper
git clone https://github.com/{user}/{repo}.git

cd ${PROJECT}

git remote add upstream https://github.com/apache/incubator-devlake.git
# Never push to upstream locally
git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
```

2. Confirm the remotes you've set is make sense

Execute `git remote -v` and you'll see output like below:

```sh
origin  git@github.com:merico-dev/lake.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:merico-dev/lake.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/apache/incubator-devlake.git (fetch)
upstream        no_push (push)
```

## Step 3 - Keep your branch in sync

You will often need to update your local code to keep in sync with upstream

```sh
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git rebase upstream/main
```

## Step 4 - Coding

First, you need to pull a new branch, the name is according to your own taste.

```sh
git checkout -b feat-xxx
```

Then start coding.

## Step 5 - Commit & Push

```sh
git add <file>
git commit -s -m "some description here"
git push -f origin feat-xxx
```
