# Contributing to Issues
> @Klesh

Last week(2022-05-12), we had 2 designated Good First Issues listed out for everyone
in a First Come, First Served manner, which was fun, and they were taken almost instantly...
but not so fun for those who were interested and failed to get one.

So, we decided, no more competition, you can pick whatever 
you like from our github issue pages, or even create your own one if no more left! 
We are community after all!

Now, how do we proceed? It's simple! Go to our [issues page](https://github.com/apache/incubator-devlake/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), and then click here. all our Good First Issue are listed out here.

- Firstly, go for an existing issue if any and find one that you like. 
Then you can claim it by posting a comment like "I'll take it".
You can choose to write a Plan of Attack to show your understanding of the problem and 
what steps would you take to solve the problem and then start working on PR for the issue. 

- Secondly, what if there are no more GFI (Good First Issues) left?
Create your own issues! By looking into our code base, 
you can find some problems. This could be related to documentation, unit-tests or even typos. 
File issues for things that don't feel right and we will verify if it is valid concern.
Once the issue is approved, and you claim it, you can work on it. 

- You may ask, why would I go through all these troubles to write code for you? 
You don't code for us, you code for everyone in the community. You code for yourself, 
for your skills and to learn how to work with other open source development teams. For those who made significant contribution,  
we may offer you a seat as an Apache Committer, or even a PPMC.

That's all, feel free to ask any questions. And Happy Coding!
