## Guide for Signing the Apache ICLA

Apache CLA, short for Apache Contributor License Agreement, has the purpose of clearly defining the terms under which intellectual property of individual contributors will be contributed to the ASF. This agreement allows us to defend the project if there are any legal disputes regarding to the software in the future.
A signed ICLA is required to be on file before an individual is given commit rights to any ASF project.

If you have already signed an Apache ICLA for the project you have contributed to in any circumstances before, there is no need to resend it to the ASF secretary. If you have have never signed an ICLA, please follow the steps below to submit your ICLA:


1. First, click the link [Apache Licenses](https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas) and find CLAs under the Contributor License Agreements section.**
