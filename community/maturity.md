# Maturity Assessment for Apache DevLake™

The goals of this maturity model are to describe how Apache projects operate in a concise and high-level way, and to provide a basic framework that projects may choose to use to evaluate themselves.

More details can be found [here](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html).

## Status of this assessment

This assessment is being evaluated during DevLake's graduation from Apache Incubator to a top-level Apache project.

## Maturity model assessment

The following table is filled according to the [Apache Maturity Model](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html). Mentors and community members are welcome to comment and modify it.
