## What is Apache DevLake?
Apache DevLake is an open-source dev data platform that ingests, analyzes, and visualizes the fragmented data from DevOps tools to distill insights for engineering productivity.

Apache DevLake is designed for developer teams looking to make better sense of their development process and to bring a more data-driven approach to their own practices. You can ask Apache DevLake many questions regarding your development process. Just connect and query.

## What can be accomplished with Apache DevLake?
1. Collect DevOps data across the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and connect the siloed data with a standard [data model](../05-DataModels/01-DevLakeDomainLayerSchema.md).
2. Provide out-of-the-box engineering [metrics](../06-EngineeringMetrics.md) to be visualized in a sereis of dashboards.
3. Allow a flexible [framework](02-Architecture.md) for data collection ad ETL to support customizable data analysis.
