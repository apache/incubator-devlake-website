# Feishu

## Summary

This plugin collects Feishu data through [Feishu Openapi](https://open.feishu.cn/document/home/user-identity-introduction/introduction).

## Configuration

In order to fully use this plugin, you will need to get app_id and app_secret from feishu administrator(For help on App info, please see [official Feishu Docs](https://open.feishu.cn/document/ukTMukTMukTM/ukDNz4SO0MjL5QzM/auth-v3/auth/tenant_access_token_internal)), 
then set these two configurations via Dev Lake's `.env`.

### By `.env`

The connection aspect of the configuration screen requires the following key fields to connect to the Feishu API. As Feishu is a single-source data provider at the moment, the connection name is read-only as there is only one instance to manage. As we continue our development roadmap we may enable multi-source connections for Feishu in the future.

FEISHU_APPID=app_id

FEISHU_APPSCRECT=app_secret


## Collect Data From Feishu

In order to collect data, you have to compose a JSON looks like following one, and send it by selecting `Advanced Mode` on `Create Pipeline Run` page:
numOfDaysToCollectï¼š The number of days you want to collect
rateLimitPerSecond: The number of requests to send(Maximum is 8)

```json
[
  [
    {
      "plugin": "feishu",
      "options": {
        "numOfDaysToCollect" : 80,
        "rateLimitPerSecond" : 5
      }
    }
  ]
]
```

You can also trigger data collection by making a POST request to `/pipelines`.
```
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8080/pipelines' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '
  {
    "name": "feishu 20211126",
    "tasks": [[{
      "plugin": "feishu",
      "options": {
        "numOfDaysToCollect" : 80,
        "rateLimitPerSecond" : 5
      }
    }]]
  }
'
```
