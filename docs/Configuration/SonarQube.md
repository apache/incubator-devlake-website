Visit Config UI at: `http://localhost:4000`.

## Step 1 - Add Data Connections

![sonarqube-add-data-connections](/img/ConfigUI/sonarqube-add-data-connections.png)

### Connection Name

Name your connection.

### Endpoint URL

This should be a valid REST API endpoint

- `http://<host>:<port>/api/`

The endpoint url should end with `/`.

### Token

SonarQube token is required to add a connection. Learn about [how to create a SonarQube token](https://sonarqube.inria.fr/sonarqube/documentation/user-guide/user-token/).

### Proxy URL (Optional)

If you are behind a corporate firewall or VPN you may need to utilize a proxy server. Enter a valid proxy server address on your network, e.g. `http://your-proxy-server.com:1080`

### Fixed Rate Limit (Optional)

DevLake uses a dynamic rate limit at around 18,000 requests/hour to collect SonarQube data. You can adjust the rate limit if you want to increase or lower the speed.

### Test and Save Connection

Click `Test Connection`, if the connection is successful, click `Save Connection` to add the connection.

## Step 2 - Setting Data Scope

### Projects

Choose the SonarQube projects to collect.

### Data Entities

Usually, you don't have to modify this part. However, if you don't want to collect certain SonarQube entities, you can unselect some entities to accerlerate the collection speed.

- Code Quality Domain: SonarQube issues, issue code blocks, file metrics, hotspots, etc.
- Cross Domain: SonarQube accounts, etc.

## Step 3 - Adding Transformation Rules (Optional)
SonarQube does not have transformation and this step will be skipped.

## Step 4 - Setting Sync Policy

You can choose how often you would like to sync your data in this step by selecting a sync frequency option or enter a cron code to specify your prefered schedule.
