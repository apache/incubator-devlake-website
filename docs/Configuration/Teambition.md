### Connection Name
Give your connection a unique name to help you identify it in the future.

#### Endpoint URL
This should be a valid REST API endpoint
   - `https://open.teambition.com/api/`
The endpoint url should end with `/`.

### App Id/Secret Key
Input the app id and secret key of your Teambition account, you can follow the steps as below.

### Proxy URL (Optional)

If you are behind a corporate firewall or VPN you may need to utilize a proxy server. Enter a valid proxy server address on your network, e.g. `http://your-proxy-server.com:1080`

### Ralte Limit (Optional)
For Teambition, we suggest you setting the rate limit to 5000

### Test and Save Connection
Click `Test Connection`, if the connection is successful, click `Save Connection` to add the connection.

## Step 2 - Configure Blueprint

Similar to other beta plugins, Teambition does not support `project`, which means, you can only collect Teambition data via blueprint's advanced mode.

Please go to the `Blueprints` page and switch to advanced mode. See how to use advanced mode and JSON [examples](AdvancedMode.md#11-Teambition).
