# Summary

For some metric calculations such as the `DORA` metric, we often encounter situations requiring comprehensive calculations based on data from multiple data sources.

For example, we may use `GitLab` for code hosting, `Jenkins` for CI/CD, to calculate PR deployment cycle time, we need to know which `GitLab Projects` and `Jenkins Jobs` are related for correctness and performance reasons.

However, in most cases, we have multiple `GitLab Projects` / `Jenkins Jobs` that belong to different teams in our Apache DevLake database.

To distinguish them into different groups. The `Project` is introduced in v0.15. Essentially, a `project` consists of a set of [Scopes](../Overview/KeyConcepts.md#data-scope), i.e., a couple of `GitLab Projects`, `Jira Boards` or `Jenkins Jobs`, etc.

`Project` is **a set of [Scope](../Overview/KeyConcepts.md#data-scope) from different domains**, a way to group different resources, and it is crucial for some metric calculation like `Dora`.

Next, let us introduce `Project` in the following order:
- `Project` related models
- Related APIs that can be used to manipulate `Project` models
- The interface that needs to be implemented when developing various plugins to support the `Project`.
	- The interface that needs to be implemented to develop the `Data Source Plugin`
	- The interface that needs to be implemented to develop the `Metric Plugins`

# Models

To support project we contains the following three models:
 - `projects` describes a project object, including its name, creation and update time and other basic information
 - `project_metric_settings` describes what metric plugins a project had enabled.
 - `project_mapping` describes the mapping relationship of project and scope, including the name of the project„ÄÅthe table name of [Scope](../Overview/KeyConcepts.md#data-scope) and the row_id in the [Scope](../Overview/KeyConcepts.md#data-scope) table.

# The interface that needs to be implemented

We divide plugins into two categories
- The first category is `Data Source Plugin`, such as `GitLab` `GitHub` `Jira` `Jenkins`, etc. These plugins collect data from various data sources
- The second category is `Metric Plugin`, such as `Dora`, etc. These plugins do not directly contact the data source but do secondary calculations based on the collected data after the `Data Source Plugin` works

## Data Source Plugin

For example `GitLab` `GitHub` `Jira` `Jenkins` etc.

These plugins, from various data sources, extract data into the database and store them, they deal directly with the data source, so we classify them as `Data Source Plugin`.

## the DataSourcePluginBlueprintV200 interface

`Data Source Plugin` needs to implement `DataSourcePluginBlueprintV200` interface to support `project`

The interface definition for this interface is as follows

```go
// DataSourcePluginBlueprintV200 extends the V100 to provide support for
// Project, so that complex metrics like DORA can be implemented based on a set
// of Data Scopes
type DataSourcePluginBlueprintV200 interface {
	MakeDataSourcePipelinePlanV200(
		connectionId uint64,
		scopes []*BlueprintScopeV200,
		syncPolicy BlueprintSyncPolicy,
	) (PipelinePlan, []Scope, errors.Error)
}
```

`scopes` in input parameters is a set of arrays containing IDs, Names, and Entities.

The input data format is as follows:

```go
[]*core.BlueprintScopeV200{
	{
		Entities: []string{"CODE", "TICKET",  "CICD"},
		Id:       "37",
		Name:     "test",
	},
}
```

`syncPolicy` in input parameters contains some option settings, whose structure is defined as follows:

```go
type BlueprintSyncPolicy struct {
	Version          string     `json:"version" validate:"required,semver,oneof=1.0.0"`
	SkipOnFail       bool       `json:"skipOnFail"`
	CreatedDateAfter *time.Time `json:"createdDateAfter"`
}
```

`PipelinePlan` in output is a part of blueprint JSON:

The input data format is as follows:(Take GitLab plugin as an example)

```go
core.PipelinePlan{
	{
		{
			Plugin: "gitlab",
			Subtasks: []string{
				tasks.ConvertProjectMeta.Name,
				tasks.CollectApiIssuesMeta.Name,
				tasks.ExtractApiIssuesMeta.Name,
				tasks.ConvertIssuesMeta.Name,
				tasks.ConvertIssueLabelsMeta.Name,
				tasks.CollectApiJobsMeta.Name,
				tasks.ExtractApiJobsMeta.Name,
				tasks.CollectApiPipelinesMeta.Name,
				tasks.ExtractApiPipelinesMeta.Name,
			},
			Options: map[string]interface{}{
				"connectionId": uint64(1),
				"projectId":    testID,
			},
		},
		{
			Plugin: "gitextractor",
			Options: map[string]interface{}{
				"proxy":  "",
				"repoId": repoId,
				"url":    "https://git:nddtf@this_is_cloneUrl",
			},
		},
	},
	{
		{
			Plugin: "refdiff",
			Options: map[string]interface{}{
				"tagsLimit":   10,
				"tagsOrder":   "reverse semver",
				"tagsPattern": "pattern",
			},
		},
	},
}
```

`project` needs to provide a specific set of [Scopes](../Overview/KeyConcepts.md#data-scope) for a specific `connection` to the plugin through this interface, and then obtain the plugin involved in the `PipelineTask` All `plugins` and corresponding parameter information. At the same time, the plugin needs to convert entities like `repo` and `board` in the data source into a `scope interface` that `project` can understand
   
The corresponding `scope interface` has been implemented at following files of in the framework layer:
- `models/domainlayer/devops/cicd_scope.go`
- `models/domainlayer/ticket/board.go`
- `models/domainlayer/code/repo.go`

In the `plugins/gitlab/impl/impl.go` file, there is a `GitLab` plugin implementation of the above interface, which can be used as a reference.

And the `plugins/gitlab/api/blueprint_v200.go` contains implementation details. 

The following files contain the models that the relevant implementations depend on for reference:
- `plugins/gitlab/models/project.go`
- `plugins/gitlab/models/scope_config.go`

## Metric Plugins

For example `Dora`, and `Refdff` plugins belong to the `Metric Plugins`

These plugins are mainly for calculating various metrics, they do not directly contact the data source, so we classify them as `Metric Plugins`.

## The PluginMetric Interface

`Metric Plugins` needs to implement the `PluginMetric` interface to support `project`

The interface definition for this interface looks like this:

```go
type PluginMetric interface {
	// returns a list of required data entities and expected features.
	// [{ "model": "cicd_tasks", "requiredFields": {"column": "type", "execptedValue": "Deployment"}}, ...]
	RequiredDataEntities() (data []map[string]interface{}, err errors.Error)

	// returns if the metric depends on Project for calculation.
	// Currently, only dora would return true.
	IsProjectMetric() bool

	// indicates which plugins must be executed before executing this one.
	// declare a set of dependencies with this
	RunAfter() ([]string, errors.Error)

	// returns an empty pointer of the plugin setting struct.
	// (no concrete usage at this point)
	Settings() (p interface{})
}

```

`Project` needs `PluginMetric` to know whether a `Metric Plugin` is dependent on `project`, and the tables and fields required in its calculation process.
 
In the `plugins/dora/impl/impl.go` file, there is a `Dora` plugin implementation of the above interface, which can be used as a sample reference.You can find it by searching the following fields:
- `func (plugin Dora) RequiredDataEntities() (data []map[string]interface{}, err errors.Error)`
- `func (plugin Dora) IsProjectMetric() bool`
- `func (plugin Dora) RunAfter() ([]string, errors.Error)`
- `func (plugin Dora) Settings() interface{}`
