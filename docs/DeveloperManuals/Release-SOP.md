# DevLake Release Guide

**Please make sure your public key was included in the https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/devlake/KEYS , if not, please update this file first.**

## How to update KEYS

1. Clone the svn repository
   ```shell
   svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/devlake
   ```
2. Append your public key to the KEYS file
   cd devlake

   - Check if your public key is in the KEYS file
   - If it does not, create a new [GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key), and then run the following command to see if it was successful.

   ```shell
   gpg --list-sigs <your name>
   ```

   - Append your publick key

   ```shell
       gpg --armor --export <your name> >> KEYS
   ```

3. Upload
   ```shell
   svn add KEYS
   svn commit -m "update KEYS"
   svn cp https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/devlake/KEYS https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/devlake/ -m "update KEYS"
   ```
   We will use `v0.16.0` as an example to demonstrate the release process.

## ASF Release Policy

- https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html
- https://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html

## Tools:

- `gpg` creating and verifying the signature
- `shasum` creating and verifying the checksum
- `git` checkout and pack the codebase
- `svn` uploading the code to the Apache code hosting server

## Prepare

- Check against the Incubator Release Checklist
- Create folder `releases/lake-v0.16.0` and put the two files `docker-compose.yml` and `env.example` in there.
- Update the file `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml` to include the version `v0.16.0`

## Pack

- Checkout to the branch/commit

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-devlake.git
cd incubator-devlake
git checkout b268d53a48edb26d3c9b73b782798703f068f655
```

- Tag the commit and push to origin

  ```shell
  git tag v0.16.0-rc2
  git push origin v0.16.0-rc2
  ```

- Pack the code
  ```shell
  git archive --format=tar.gz --output="<the-output-dir>/apache-devlake-0.16.0-incubating-src.tar.gz" --prefix="apache-devlake-0.16.0-incubating-src/" v0.16.0-rc2
  ```
- Before proceeding to the next step, please make sure your public key was included in the https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/devlake/KEYS
- Create signature and checksum
  ```shell
  cd <the-output-dir>
  gpg -s --armor --output apache-devlake-0.16.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc --detach-sig apache-devlake-0.16.0-incubating-src.tar.gz
  shasum -a 512  apache-devlake-0.16.0-incubating-src.tar.gz > apache-devlake-0.16.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.sha512
  ```
- Verify signature and checksum
  ```shell
  gpg --verify apache-devlake-0.16.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc apache-devlake-0.16.0-incubating-src.tar.gz
  shasum -a 512 --check apache-devlake-0.16.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.sha512
  ```

## Upload

- Clone the svn repository
  ```shell
  svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/devlake
  ```
- Copy the files into the svn local directory
  ```shell
  cd devlake
  mkdir -p 0.16.0-incubating-rc2
  cp <the-output-dir>/apache-devlake-0.16.0-incubating-src.tar.gz* 0.16.0-incubating-rc2/
  ```
- Upload local files
  ```shell
  svn add 0.16.0-incubating-rc2
  svn commit -m "add 0.16.0-incubating-rc2"
  ```

  ----
  Disclaimer: Apache DevLake(incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache
  Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.

  Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
  indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
  have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.

  While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
  or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
  fully endorsed by the ASF.

  ```shell
  git checkout v0.16.0-rc2
  git tag v0.16.0
