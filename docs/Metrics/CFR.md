  DORA - Change Failure Rate
sidebar_position: 29
---

## What is this metric? 
The percentage of changes that were made to a code that then resulted in incidents, rollbacks, or any type of production failure.

## Why is it important?
Unlike Deployment Frequency and Lead Time for Changes that measure the throughput, Change Failure Rate measures the stability and quality of software delivery. A low CFR reflects a bad end-user experience as the production failure is relatively high.

## Which dashboard(s) does it exist in
DORA dashboard. See [live demo](https://grafana-lake.demo.devlake.io/grafana/d/qNo8_0M4z/dora?orgId=1).


## How is it calculated?
The number of failures per the number of deployments. For example, if there are five deployments in a day and one causes a failure, that is a 20% change failure rate.

Below are the benchmarks for different development teams from Google's report. However, it's difficult to tell which group a team falls into when the team's change failure rate is `18%` or `40%`. Therefore, DevLake provides its own benchmarks to address this problem:

| Groups           | Benchmarks      | DevLake Benchmarks |
| -----------------| ----------------| -------------------|
| Elite performers | 0%-15%          | 0%-15%             |
| High performers  | 16%-30%         | 16-20%             |
| Medium performers| 16%-30%         | 21%-30%            |
| Low performers   | 16%-30%         | > 30%              |

<b>Data Sources Required</b>

This metric relies on:
- `Deployments` collected in one of the following ways:
  - Open APIs of Jenkins, GitLab, GitHub, etc.
  - Webhook for general CI tools.
  - Releases and PR/MRs from GitHub, GitLab APIs, etc.
- `Incidents` collected in one of the following ways:
  - Issue tracking tools such as Jira, TAPD, GitHub, etc.
  - Bug or Service Monitoring tools such as PagerDuty, Sentry, etc.
  - CI pipelines that marked the 'failed' deployments.

<b>Transformation Rules Required</b>

This metric relies on:
- Deployment configuration in Jenkins, GitLab or GitHub transformation rules to let DevLake know what CI builds/jobs can be regarded as `Deployments`.
- Incident configuration in Jira, GitHub or TAPD transformation rules to let DevLake know what CI builds/jobs can be regarded as `Incidents`.

<b>SQL Queries</b>

If you want to measure the monthly trend of change failure rate as the picture shown below, run the following SQL in Grafana.

![](/img/Metrics/cfr-monthly.jpeg)

```
with _deployments as (
-- get the deployment count each month
	SELECT
		date_format(finished_date,'%y/%m') as month,
		COUNT(distinct id) AS deployment_count
	FROM
		cicd_tasks
	WHERE
		type = 'DEPLOYMENT'
		and result = 'SUCCESS'
	GROUP BY 1
),

_incidents as (
-- get the incident count each month
	SELECT
		date_format(created_date,'%y/%m') as month,
		COUNT(distinct id) AS incident_count
	FROM
		issues
	WHERE
		type = 'INCIDENT'
	GROUP BY 1
),

_calendar_months as(
-- deal with the month with no incidents
	SELECT date_format(CAST((SYSDATE()-INTERVAL (month_index) MONTH) AS date), '%y/%m') as month
	FROM ( SELECT 0 month_index
			UNION ALL SELECT   1  UNION ALL SELECT   2 UNION ALL SELECT   3
			UNION ALL SELECT   4  UNION ALL SELECT   5 UNION ALL SELECT   6
			UNION ALL SELECT   7  UNION ALL SELECT   8 UNION ALL SELECT   9
			UNION ALL SELECT   10 UNION ALL SELECT  11
		) month_index
	WHERE (SYSDATE()-INTERVAL (month_index) MONTH) > SYSDATE()-INTERVAL 6 MONTH	
)

SELECT 
	cm.month,
	case 
		when d.deployment_count is null or i.incident_count is null then 0 
		else i.incident_count/d.deployment_count end as change_failure_rate
FROM 
	_calendar_months cm
	left join _incidents i on cm.month = i.month
	left join _deployments d on cm.month = d.month
ORDER BY 1
```

If you want to measure in which category your team falls into as the picture shown below, run the following SQL in Grafana.

![](/img/Metrics/cfr-monthly.jpeg)

```
with _deployment_count as (
-- get the deployment deployed within the selected time period in the top-right corner
	SELECT
		COUNT(distinct id) AS deployment_count
	FROM
		cicd_tasks
	WHERE
		type = 'DEPLOYMENT'
		and result = 'SUCCESS'
    and $__timeFilter(finished_date)
),

_incident_count as (
-- get the incident created within the selected time period in the top-right corner
	SELECT
		COUNT(distinct id) AS incident_count
	FROM
		issues
	WHERE
		type = 'INCIDENT'
		and $__timeFilter(created_date)
)

SELECT 
	case 
		when deployment_count is null or incident_count is null or deployment_count = 0 then NULL 
		when incident_count/deployment_count <= .15 then "0-15%"
		when incident_count/deployment_count <= .20 then "16%-20%"
		when incident_count/deployment_count <= .30 then "21%-30%"
		else "> 30%"
		end as change_failure_rate
FROM 
	_deployment_count, _incident_count
```

## How to improve?
- Add unit tests for all new feature
- "Shift left", start QA early and introduce more automated tests
- Enforce code review if it's not strictly executed
