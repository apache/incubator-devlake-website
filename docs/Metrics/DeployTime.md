## What is this metric? 
The time it takes from when a PR is merged to when it is deployed.

## Why is it important?
1. Based on historical data, establish a baseline of the delivery capacity of a single iteration to improve the organization and planning of R&D resources.
2. Evaluate whether the delivery capacity matches the business phase and demand scale. Identify key bottlenecks and reasonably allocate resources.
