## Configuration
Configuring Jira via [config-ui](/UserManuals/ConfigUI/Jira.md).

## Collect Data From JIRA

To collect data, select `Advanced Mode` on the `Create Pipeline Run` page and paste a JSON config like the following:

> <font color="#ED6A45">Warning: Data collection only supports single-task execution, and the results of concurrent multi-task execution may not meet expectations.</font>

```
[
  [
    {
      "plugin": "jira",
      "options": {
          "connectionId": 1,
          "boardId": 8,
          "since": "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"
      }
    }
  ]
]
```

- `connectionId`: The `ID` field from **JIRA Integration** page.
- `boardId`: JIRA board id, see "Find Board Id" for details.
- `since`: optional, download data since a specified date only.


## API

### Data Connections

1. Get all data connection

```GET /plugins/jira/connections
[
  {
    "ID": 14,
    "CreatedAt": "2021-10-11T11:49:19.029Z",
    "UpdatedAt": "2021-10-11T11:49:19.029Z",

]
```

2. Create a new data connection

```POST /plugins/jira/connections

	"epicKeyField": "name of customfield of epic key",
	"storyPointField": "name of customfield of story point",
	"typeMappings": { // optional, send empty object to delete all typeMappings of the data connection
		"userType": {
			"standardType": "devlake standard type"
		}
	}
}
```


3. Update data connection

```PUT /plugins/jira/connections/:connectionId
{
	"name": "jira data connection name",
	"endpoint": "jira api endpoint, i.e. https://merico.atlassian.net/rest",
    "basicAuthEncoded": "generated by `echo -n {jira login email}:{jira token} | base64`",
	"epicKeyField": "name of customfield of epic key",

	}
}
```

5. Delete data connection

```DELETE /plugins/jira/connections/:connectionId
```


### Type mappings

1. Get all type mappings
```GET /plugins/jira/connections/:connectionId/type-mappings
[
  {
    "jiraConnectionId": 16,

    "standardType": "standardType"
  }
]
```

2. Create a new type mapping

```POST /plugins/jira/connections/:connectionId/type-mappings
{
    "userType": "userType",
    "standardType": "standardType"

```

3. Update type mapping

```PUT /plugins/jira/connections/:connectionId/type-mapping/:userType
{
    "standardType": "standardTypeUpdated"
}
```


4. Delete type mapping

```DELETE /plugins/jira/connections/:connectionId/type-mapping/:userType
```

5. API forwarding
For example:
Requests to `http://your_devlake_host/plugins/jira/connections/1/proxy/rest/agile/1.0/board/8/sprint`
would be forwarded to `https://your_jira_host/rest/agile/1.0/board/8/sprint`

```GET /plugins/jira/connections/:connectionId/proxy/rest/*path
{
    "maxResults": 1,
    "startAt": 0,
    "isLast": false,
    "values": [
        {
            "id": 7,
            "self": "https://merico.atlassian.net/rest/agile/1.0/sprint/7",
            "state": "closed",
            "name": "EE Sprint 7",
            "startDate": "2020-06-12T00:38:51.882Z",
            "endDate": "2020-06-26T00:38:00.000Z",
            "completeDate": "2020-06-22T05:59:58.980Z",
            "originBoardId": 8,
            "goal": ""
        }
    ]
}
```
