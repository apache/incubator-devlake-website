### `panic: invalid encKey` error

The cause is the `devlake` container trying to decrypt data in the database with the wrong key.
Please check the [GettingStarted/Upgrade](../GettingStarted/Upgrade.md) doc for more detail.

## None of them solve your problem?

Sorry for the inconvenience, please help us improve by [creating an issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-devlake/issues)
