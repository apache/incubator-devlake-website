#### Connection Name
Name your connection.

#### Endpoint URL
This should be a valid REST API endpoint. 
   - If you are using gitlab.com, the endpoint will be `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/`
   - If you are self-hosting GitLab, the endpoint will look like `https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/`
The endpoint url should end with `/`.

#### Auth Token(s)
GitLab personal access tokens are required to add a connection. Learn about [how to create a GitLab personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html).


#### Proxy URL (Optional)
If you are behind a corporate firewall or VPN you may need to utilize a proxy server. Enter a valid proxy server address on your network, e.g. `http://your-proxy-server.com:1080`

#### Test and Save Connection
Click `Test Connection`, if the connection is successful, click `Save Connection` to add the connection.

- Source Code Management: GitLab repos, refs, commits, etc.
- Code Review: GitLab MRs, MR comments and reviews, etc.
- CI/CD: GitLab pipelines, jobs, etc.
- Cross Domain: GitLab accounts, etc.

### Step 3 - Adding Transformation Rules (Optional)
There are no transformation rules for GitLab repos.

### Step 4 - Setting Sync Frequency
