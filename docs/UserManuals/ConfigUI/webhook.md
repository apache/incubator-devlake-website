#### Webhook name
We recommend that you give your webhook connection a unique name so that you can identify and manage where you have used it later.

### Use Webhooks
After clicking on "Generate POST URL", you will find four webhook URLs. Copy the ones that suit your usage into your CI or issue-tracking systems. You can always come back to the webhook page to copy the URLs later on.
