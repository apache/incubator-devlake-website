## Goals
1. Moving to Apache Incubator and making DevLake a graduation-ready project.
2. Explore and implement 3 typical use scenarios to help certain engineering teams and developers:
   - Observation of open-source project contribution and quality
   - DORA metrics for the DevOps team
   - SDLC workflow monitoring and improvement
3. Better UX for end-users and contributors.
