## What is this metric? 
The time it takes from when a PR is issued to when it is merged. Essentially, PR Time to Merge = PR Pickup Time + PR Review Time.

## Why is it important?
The delay of reviewing and waiting to review PRs has large impact on delivery speed, while reasonably short PR Time to Merge can indicate frictionless teamwork. Improving on this metric is the key to reduce PR cycle time.
