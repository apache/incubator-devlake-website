  PagerDuty Plugin

## Summary

This plugin collects all incidents from PagerDuty, and uses them to compute incident-type DORA metrics. These include
[Median time to restore service](/Metrics/MTTR.md) and [Change failure rate](/Metrics/CFR.md).

As of v0.15.x, the `PagerDuty` plugin can only be invoked through the DevLake API. Its support in Config-UI is WIP.


## Usage via DevLake API

> Note: Please replace the `http://localhost:8080` in the sample requests with your actual DevLake API endpoint. For how to view DevLake API's swagger documentation, please refer to the "Using DevLake API" section of [Developer Setup](../DeveloperManuals/DeveloperSetup.md).


1. Create a PagerDuty data connection: `POST /plugins/pagerduty/connections`. Please see a sample request below:

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/plugins/pagerduty/connections' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "PagerDuty-test1",
    "endpoint": "https://api.PagerDuty.com",
    "token": "<api-access-token>"
}'
```

2. Create a blueprint to collect data from PagerDuty: `POST /blueprints`. Please see a sample request below:

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/blueprints' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "cronConfig": "manual",
    "enable": true,
    "isManual": true,
    "mode": "NORMAL",
    "name": "test-blueprint",
    "settings": {
        "connections": [
            {
                "connectionId": 1,
                "plugin": "PagerDuty",
                "scope": [
                    {
                        "entities": [
                            "TICKET"
                        ],
                        "options": {
                            "connectionId": 1,
                            "start_date": "2022-06-01T15:04:05Z"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "version": "1.0.0"
    }
}'
```

Here `start_date` is the time sinch which all created incidents will be collected. Entities may be blank: the only 
allowed entity is `"TICKET"` which will be used as default.

3. [Optional] Trigger the blueprint manually: `POST /blueprints/{blueprintId}/trigger`. Run this step if you want to trigger the newly created blueprint right away. See an example request below:

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/blueprints/<blueprintId>/trigger' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Note the incidents are extracted from the `issues` table in MySQL with the condition `type = 'INCIDENT'`.
