  Plugin Implementation

Plugins are code extensions that enable you to pull data from data-sources and present them in DevLake. 
They can be implemented in both Go and Python. The framework itself is written in Go, and Python (called PyDevLake) is a supplemental extension to 
support developers who prefer it using it. PyDevLake is relatively brand new, and we would like to see it gain more traction; we encourage you to give it 
a try if you are familiar with Python.

The Go development manual can be found [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-devlake/blob/main/backend/DevelopmentManual.md). This manual also covers the framework in detail.

The Python development manual can be found [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-devlake/blob/main/backend/python/README.md).
