Visit Config UI at : `http://localhost:4000` and go to `Connections` page.

## Step 1 - Add Data Connections

### Step 1.1 - Authentication

#### Connection Name

Give your connection a unique name to help you identify it in the future.

#### Endpoint URL

For CircleCI, you do not need to enter the REST API endpoint URL, which is always `https://circleci.com/api/`.


#### Token

Learn about [Managing API Tokens](https://circleci.com/docs/managing-api-tokens/).

Tokens you have generated that can be used to access the CircleCI API. Apps using these tokens can act as you and have full read- and write-permissions!
There are two types of API token(Personal and Project) you can create within CircleCI.


#### Proxy URL (Optional)

If you are behind a corporate firewall or VPN you may need to utilize a proxy server. Enter a valid proxy server address on your network, e.g. `http://your-proxy-server.com:1080`


#### Fixed Rate Limit (Optional)

DevLake uses a dynamic rate limit to collect CircleCI data. You can adjust the rate limit if you want to increase or lower the speed.
Learn more about [CircleCI API rate limit](https://circleci.com/docs/api-developers-guide/#rate-limits).


#### Test and Save Connection

Click `Test Connection`, if the connection is successful, click `Save Connection` to add the connection.

### Step 1.2 - Configure Data Scope

#### Projects

Select the CircleCI projects to collect.

### Step 1.3 - Adding Scope Config (Optional)

You can add a `transformation` to standardize the data. A `transformation` acts on the CircleCI data in the [tool layer](/docs/DataModels/ToolLayerSchema.md), transforming it to the [domain layer](/docs/DataModels/DevLakeDomainLayerSchema.md).

## Step 2 - Collect Data in a Project
### Step 2.1 - Create a Project
Collecting CircleCI data requires creating a project first. You can visit the Project page from the side menu and create a new project by following the instructions on the user interface.

### Step 2.2 - Add a CircleCI Connection
You can add a previously configured CircleCI connection to the project and select the boards for which you wish to collect the data for.
Please note: if you don't see the repositories you are looking for, please check if you have added them to the connection first.

### Step 2.3 - Set the Sync Policy
There are three settings for Sync Policy:
- Data Time Range: You can select the time range of the data you wish to collect. The default is set to the past six months.
- Sync Frequency: You can choose how often you would like to sync your data in this step by selecting a sync frequency option or enter a cron code to specify your preferred schedule.
- Skip Failed Tasks: sometime a few tasks may fail in a long pipeline; you can choose to skip them to avoid spending more time in running the pipeline all over again.

### Step 2.4 - Start Data Collection
Click on "Collect Data" to start collecting data for the whole project. You can check the status in the Status tab on the same page.
